# Mutli-clipboard utility

Lately I've found myself having to retype sentences with similar phrasing over and over again. Storing these sentences in a file is fine for a few elements but as it grows it becomes harder to find what you're looking for.

So I created this little command line utility that returns your string from a given keyword and copies it to the clipboard.
